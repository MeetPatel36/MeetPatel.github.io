## **Data Science Projects:**

### Project 1: Canada's Mental Health Analysis

In this analysis, my team explored mental health data from Statistics Canada to examine the state of mental health among Canadians and identify ways to improve awareness of available services. This Jupyter notebook highlights my contributions to the project. I focused on analyzing the modes of communication Canadians use when discussing mental health issues, such as video calls, text messages, or in-person meetings. Additionally, I examined the frequency of consultations and the types of professionals involved, including nurses and family doctors.
